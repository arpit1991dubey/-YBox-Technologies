3. I've user react-navigation V-5 here.
4. The redux and all the content is located inside src directory.
5. The size of this app has increased a lot because of the high quality pictures that i've used, i could also have uses uri links to get the images everytime the app opens, but to make the process faster i added them in the local assets directory.  
6. Do let me know if you face any issues(arpitdubey907@gmail.com).
